# Data and Feature Lineage

Use this guide to ensure traceability for model lifecycle decisions.

## Lineage Baseline

Define:
- Dataset sources and owners
- Feature generation paths and dependencies
- Version identifiers for datasets/features

## Quality and Governance Controls

Include:
- Data quality checks at lineage boundaries
- Ownership and change approval model
- Evidence for reproducibility and audits

## Traceability Requirement

For each deployed model, be able to trace:
- Data version
- Feature version
- Training code/config version
- Evaluation evidence version

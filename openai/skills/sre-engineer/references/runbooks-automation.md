# Runbooks and Automation

Use this guide to improve response repeatability and reduce toil.

## Runbook Quality Baseline

Each runbook should include:
- Trigger conditions
- Preconditions and safety checks
- Step-by-step actions
- Verification of recovery
- Rollback path

## Automation Prioritization

Prioritize automation by:
- Incident frequency
- Impact severity
- Manual effort
- Error-proneness

## Automation Safety

Before enabling automation define:
- Guardrails and blast-radius controls
- Rollback/fail-safe behavior
- Ownership and monitoring

## Toil Reduction Tracking

Track:
- Time saved
- Incident response consistency
- Error reduction from automated actions

# Postmortem and Improvement

Use this guide to drive corrective action after incidents.

## Postmortem Standard

Capture:
- Timeline and impact summary
- Root and contributing causes
- Detection and response gaps
- What worked and what failed

## Corrective Action Model

For each action define:
- Owner
- Priority
- Due date
- Validation method

## Recurrence Prevention

Add preventive checks such as:
- Alert/runbook changes
- Automation improvements
- SLO policy updates
- Release gate adjustments

## Closure Criteria

Do not close corrective work until validation evidence is recorded.

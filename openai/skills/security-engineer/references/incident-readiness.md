# Incident Readiness

Use this guide to ensure security incidents are detectable and actionable.

## Detection Baseline

Define telemetry for:
- Privileged access changes
- Authentication anomalies
- Sensitive data access and export activity
- Control bypass attempts
- Key security gate failures

## Alerting Model

For each critical alert, define:
- Trigger conditions and thresholds
- Owner and escalation path
- Expected response time by severity

## Severity Model

Define an explicit severity ladder (for example Sev1 through Sev4) and tie it to:
- Business/user impact
- Data sensitivity impact
- Containment urgency

## Response Readiness

Ensure plans include:
- Initial containment actions
- Forensic data preservation requirements
- Communication and stakeholder notifications
- Recovery and service-hardening actions

## Post-Incident Loop

After each incident, capture:
- Root cause and control gap
- Detection gap and time-to-detect
- Corrective actions with ownership and due dates
- Validation of fixes before closure

# Compliance Mapping

Use this guide when compliance mapping is requested or required.

## Scope First

Before mapping controls, define:
- Applicable framework or policy set
- In-scope systems and data classes
- Control owners and evidence owners

## Mapping Format

For each requirement, document:
- Requirement identifier
- Implemented control(s)
- Evidence source and location
- Control owner
- Gap status and remediation plan

## Evidence Expectations

Evidence should be:
- Current and auditable
- Traceable to control execution
- Owned by a responsible team

## Gap Handling

For unmet requirements:
- Describe risk and business impact
- Define compensating control if available
- Assign remediation owner and timeline
- Track exception approval and expiry

## Compliance Boundaries

Keep compliance mapping practical:
- Do not replace threat-driven control design
- Avoid framework-only responses without technical enforcement details
- Escalate to legal/compliance stakeholders for interpretation disputes
